# NVIDIA NeMo Framework

NeMo Framework is NVIDIA's GPU accelerated, end-to-end training framework for large language models (LLMs), multi-modal models and speech models. It enables seamless scaling of training (both pretraining and post-training) workloads from single GPU to thousand-node clusters for both ü§óHugging Face/PyTorch and Megatron models. This GitHub organization includes a suite of libraries and recipe collections to help users train models from end to end.
