# NVIDIA NeMo Framework

NeMo Framework is NVIDIA's GPU accelerated, end-to-end training framework for large language models (LLMs), multi-modal models and speech models. It enables seamless scaling of training (both pretraining and post-training) workloads from single GPU to thousand-node clusters for both ü§óHugging Face/PyTorch and Megatron models. This GitHub organization includes a suite of libraries and recipe collections to help users train models from end to end. 

NeMo Framework is also a part of the NVIDIA NeMo software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle.

üì¢ Also take a look at [our blogs](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/blog/) for the latest exciting things that we are working on!

## Some background contexts and motivations
The NeMo GitHub Org and its repo collections are created to address the following problems
* **Need for composability**: The [Previous NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is monolithic and encompasses too many things, making it hard for users to find what they need. Container size is also an issue. Breaking down the Monolithic repo into a series of functional-focused repos to facilitate code discovery.
* **Need for customizability**: The [Previous NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) uses PyTorch Lighting as the default trainer loop, which provides some out of the box functionality but making it hard to customize. [NeMo Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge), [NeMo AutoModel](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel), and [NeMo RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL) have adopted pytorch native custom loop to improve flexibility and ease of use for developers.
